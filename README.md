# Pacman in JS
Just a fun little exercise making the classic arcade game.

## Day One
Got some basic features put in Player, Ghosts, Level, level advancement, score, lives, collisions, pellets, power pellets, and some very basic and terrible ghost AI. All assets are just squares of different colors at the moment as I get the logic worked out.
